## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

#some libraries that you might or might not sound useful
library(car)
library(sandwich)
library(forecast)
library(aTSA)
library(lmtest)

```





```{r}

filtdata <- read.csv("entire.csv", header = TRUE)
filtdata <- as.data.frame(filtdata)
```

```{r}
#filter out all missing data (code 999999999) and NAs
indexTooBig <- which(data1$inctot > 800000000)
filtdata <- filtdata[-indexTooBig, ]
indexNA <- which(is.na(filtdata$inctot))
filtdata <- filtdata[-indexNA, ]
#print out data1$inctot to see if that is what we expect
filtdata$inctot

#Separate out the populations, because each group would have their
#own 5-number summaries, and classify outliers differently in the 
#subpopulations

```
